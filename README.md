## direction
- rethink paper paradigm based software for spatial computing
- networked by default through a federated server model
- smart contract for handling security and value

## increment
- implement all dofs from site
- merge networking prototypes
- architect interfaces for navigation

## stream
- ~~refactor cursors to pose data ~30m~~
- ~~claw cursor ~30m~~
- ~~refactor networking code to async based on video ~1hr~~
- ~~haul the networking into stereokit ~30m~~

pb = 2:30 (end at 1:30)

- do something spatial with the data

- make a batch script for niko so he can test things easily

- connect dof site data to oriels (networking will help with capturing gifs)
