## direction
- rethink paper paradigm based software for spatial computing
- networked by default through a federated server model
- smart contract for handling security and value

## increment
- ~~merge networking prototypes~~
- architect interfaces for navigation
- implement all dofs from site

## stream
- ~~refactor cursors to pose data 30m~~
- ~~claw cursor 30m~~
- ~~refactor networking code to async based on video 1hr~~
- ~~haul the networking into stereokit 30m~~
- finish devtime tool 30m
- do something spatial with the data
- make a batch script for niko so he can test things easily

- dead simple press to step through dofs
- gif maker
