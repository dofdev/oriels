# oriels
a dof oriented os


## todo
green hills blue sky *noise bases, so a seed is all you need to sync peers

connect puncher server to the peer class

make repo public (once its in an orderly state)

make camera and specator cam a prefab?


## design
this smart contract is extensible for all dofdevs
the 12

multiuser by default
p2p, share input, and broadcast cubemap oriel streams
authority is kept local
and no latency compensation is tolerable

matchmaking? (for now input public ip addresses manually)
