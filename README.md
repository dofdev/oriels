## direction
- rethink paper paradigm based software for spatial computing
- networked by default through a federated server model
- smart contract for handling security and value

## increment
- ~~merge networking prototypes~~
- architect interfaces for navigation
- implement all dofs from site

## stream
- ~~refactor cursors to pose data 30m~~
- ~~claw cursor 30m~~
- ~~refactor networking code to async based on video 1hr~~
- ~~haul the networking into stereokit 30m~~
- ~~do something spatial with the data 48m~~

- why is the latency 20s? (client side?) // though the server needs a refactor pass *send then receive*
- make a batch script for niko so he can test things easily 32m (+script that does the "install")

- dead simple press to step through dofs
- gif maker
